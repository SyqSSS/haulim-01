        <h1>On The Ground (ROSÉ)</h1>
        <hr>
        My life's been magic seems fantastic<br>
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress<br>
It’s funny when you want it<br>
Suddenly you have it<br>
You find out that your gold’s just plastic<br><br>
Every day every night<br>
I’ve been thinking back on you and I<br>
Every day every night<br><br>
I worked my whole life<br>
Just to get right just to be like<br>
Look at me I’m never coming down<br>
I worked my whole life<br>
Just to get high just to realize<br>
Everything I need is on the<br>
Everything I need is on the ground<br><br>
<b><u>On the ground</u></b><br>
Everything I need is on the ground<br>
